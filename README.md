## 🚀 Features

*   **Live Transaction Monitoring:** A real-time dashboard that simulates and processes incoming transactions, flagging suspicious ones instantly.
*   **Dynamic Metrics:** Key performance indicators such as Total Transactions, Flagged Fraud, and Fraud Rate are updated live.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Integrated with **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to provide clear, human-readable explanations for every prediction. Users can understand *why* a transaction was flagged.
*   **All-in-One Architecture:** Built as a single, robust Streamlit application that handles data processing, model training (in-memory), prediction, and the user interface, ensuring stability and ease of deployment.
*   **Professional UI:** A clean, modern "Command Center" interface designed for usability by a fraud analyst.
